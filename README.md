=========================

I am a vinyl junky. When Iâ€™m interested in a vinyl, I want to get it at the best price.  
I always open a bunch of browser windows on all kinds of shops to find the best offer.

[Alfred app](http://www.alfredapp.com/) helps me to automate all that. I have build a custom workflow who save me a lot of time.

Just type `music` followed by your query and Alfred will open browser windows with the search results.
